             <h1>ABOUT</h1>
             <br>
             <h2>Milagros Ravasi</h2>
             <p>I wasn't one of those people who was given a camera at age five and fell in love with photography.</p>
             <br>
             <p>I was a travel journalist, working my dream job with Lonely Planet at age 23 when the magic of Marrakech begged me to take its photo.</p>
             <p>Since that trip in 2007 I became hooked on photographing patterns hidden within landscapes, extreme climates, cultures and the underwater world. My business The Wandering Lens, works with global brands producing visual content and image libraries/editorials for various publications, tourism/commercial clients and also operates as a travel photography site, which is now the leading publisher of travel guides for photographers</p>
             <br>
             <p>In 2009 I opened a landscape gallery on Hayman Island with the glimmering Great Barrier Reef at my doorstep for six years.</p>
            <br>
             <p>This location led to my obsession of documenting the environment above and below the surface. Itâ€™s the details of nature that inspire my photography. Patterns carved by climates, movement in water and colourful skies, I believe photography is as much about seeing as it is capturing.</p>
             <br>
             <p>My recent project, The Photographic Forecast, focuses on regions of environmental significance. Images from Greenland to Namibia, Chile and Australia feature in a print collection from which proceeds are donated to conservation initiatives. Click here to view the available fine art prints.</p>
             <br>
             <p>Gear wise I'm very proud to be an Olympus Visionary, working with the incredible team from Olympus Australia to showcase what this innovative brand is capable of. The OM-D E-M1 MKII is my go to camera; it's weatherproof, lightweight and has been with me underwater, in arctic conditions and searing tropical heat without failing once.</p>
             <br>
             <p>I prefer to let the photos do the talking so if you wish to know more just ask via miluravassi@hotmail.com, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
